/**
 * Subagent fan-out admission — the pure decision function plus the stateful
 * gate the bridge wires onto `tool_call` / `tool_execution_end`.
 *
 * The capability: keep a parent session alive through a wide `Agent` fan-out on
 * a loaded host by bounding how many children are in flight at once, refusing
 * the excess visibly and terminally instead of letting the parent stall and be
 * reaped. See change: bound-subagent-fanout-under-host-pressure.
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing and easy to "simplify" away:
 *
 *  - **The bound is in-flight concurrency, not batch width.** The extension
 *    `tool_call` event carries only `{type, toolCallId, toolName, input}` — the
 *    assistant message is dropped before the extension sees it — so batch size
 *    and identity are not knowable at decision time. The count rises at
 *    ADMISSION, not execution: siblings preflight before any executes, so a
 *    count keyed on execution would read zero across a whole batch and admit it.
 *  - **Release on `tool_execution_end`, never `tool_result`.** An aborted call
 *    (Esc) finalizes with an error result and `tool_execution_end` but SKIPS the
 *    path that produces the extension's `tool_result`; a counter released on
 *    `tool_result` would leak a permit on every abort and eventually refuse all
 *    subagent work for the session.
 *  - **Never wait on a child.** Siblings are preflighted sequentially and only
 *    then executed concurrently, so awaiting a child deadlocks by construction.
 *    Admission is synchronous, reject-only; it never delays an admitted call.
 *
 * See change: bound-subagent-fanout-under-host-pressure (D2/D3/D4/D6/D8).
