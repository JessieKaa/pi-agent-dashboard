/**
 * Cross-plugin work-source registration seam (the collect half).
 *
 * Any plugin publishes one contribution — `{ id, source }`, or an array of
 * them — under `automation.worksource.<source>`; this module collects the
 * published values into validated descriptors, which `server/index.ts` wraps in
 * a `WorkSourceProvider` consulted lazily by the registry. Mirrors the action
 * registry's publish/collect shape (`ACTION_CONTRIBUTION_PREFIX`), so load
 * order is irrelevant and the publishing plugin keeps ownership of its
 * instance — a work-source carries lease state, so the instance MUST be created
 * once by its owner and never re-collected into a copy.
 *
 * Deliberately domain-free: the collector validates only the structural
 * contract (`next`/`ack`/`nack`), never what an item is.
 *
 * See change: work-source-seam.
