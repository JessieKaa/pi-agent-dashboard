/**
 * Work-source registry — keyed by source id, mirroring `trigger-registry.ts`.
 *
 * Holds STABLE source instances (a work-source carries lease state, so it must
 * not be re-collected per read like the action registry). `automation-schema`
 * validates `on.source` against `ids()`; the engine resolves the instance via
 * `get(id)` at fire time.
 *
 * Two population paths, both yielding STABLE instances:
 *   - `register(id, source)` — sources this plugin constructs itself (config-
 *     declared folder sources);
 *   - `addProvider(p)` — the CROSS-PLUGIN seam: another plugin owns the
 *     instance (and therefore its lease state) and exposes it through a
 *     provider resolved lazily on every read, so plugin load order is
 *     irrelevant. Locally registered ids win a collision.
 *
 * See change: automation-work-source-fanout, work-source-seam.
