/**
 * Client boot gate for the MEMORY subcard (design D4) — mechanism #6's
 * resolution of the five failed gate attempts.
 *
 * The manifest-level `shouldRenderMemorySubcard` reads a module-level boolean
 * SYNCHRONOUSLY and fails closed until the boot check resolves (F1) — no
 * promise, no throw, no async gate path. `resolveInstalled()` fetches the
 * plugin's own `/status` route; anything other than a well-formed
 * `200 { installed: boolean }` (network error, any non-200 incl. the 404 of a
 * disabled plugin, malformed body) is TRANSIENT: it retries with capped
 * backoff (3 attempts), then continues at a slow fixed interval UNTIL the
 * first success — it never gives up, so a transient failure is never a
 * permanent false negative (mechanism-5 defect #3). After the first success
 * the value is final for the page lifetime; no re-poll. A successful resolve
 * bumps the runtime's slot-claims invalidation store (D3) so gates on idle
 * sessions that never broadcast again re-evaluate (F2).
 *
 * The module-scope kick in the client entry is GUARDED so it does not run
 * under vitest/jsdom (mechanism-5 defect #2 — the bare `fetch` broke the whole
 * test suite). The guard detects vitest specifically — `import.meta.vitest` or
 * a typeof-guarded `process.env.VITEST` read, NOT `import.meta.env.MODE`,
 * which a custom `--mode` run bypasses. The `typeof process` guard is
 * load-bearing: `process` does not exist in the browser bundle, and an
 * unguarded read at module scope would throw in production — the mirror image
 * of the breakage it prevents.
 *
 * See change: add-blackhole-session-pipeline.
