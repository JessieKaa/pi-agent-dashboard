/**
 * Provisions the dashboard's own entry into the Pi-global `mcp.json` so a local
 * pi session can reach `/mcp` (design.md Decision 5, Decision 11).
 *
 * The read → merge-one-key → atomic-write discipline now lives in the
 * `mcp-client` plugin's `./core` (`createMcpClientConfigService`); this module
 * owns only the dashboard's collision policy for its reserved key. It is a
 * package dependency, NOT a manifest `dependsOn` — provisioning degrades
 * gracefully and must not gate plugin load.
 *
 * TWO traps this module exists to avoid.
 *
 * 1. **The legacy-default trap.** Per the `pi-mcp-adapter` 2.20.0 changelog,
 *    "Legacy remains the default." An entry written WITHOUT `protocolVersion`
 *    gets the legacy handshake — `initialize` plus `Mcp-Session-Id`. The
 *    dashboard's `/mcp` DOES answer the legacy handshake now, but pi's own
 *    adapter must stay on the strict modern path: without the pin the entry
 *    would silently downgrade, and the failure would look like a config
 *    mistake rather than a deliberate choice, so `protocolVersion` is never
 *    omitted (J2). See change: mcp-legacy-clients-and-token-issuance (D7).
 *
 * 2. **The wrong-shape trap.** `ensureMcpEntry` writes a stdio `command` entry
 *    for iMCP. This endpoint is HTTP and must be declared by `url` (J1).
 *
 * See change: extract-mcp-client-plugin (task 6.2).
