/**
 * Single-use WebSocket upgrade tickets (D11 / F4 / F6).

 * A browser cannot set an Authorization header on a WebSocket, and the durable
 * bearer must NEVER ride the WS URL, header, or logs (F6). So an authenticated
 * client first mints a short-lived, single-use ticket via a REST endpoint (auth
 * by cookie or `Authorization: Bearer`), then opens the socket presenting only
 * that ephemeral ticket. The upgrade handler refuses the socket unless the
 * ticket validates — no authenticated socket ever exists before auth (no
 * TOCTOU).
 *
 * The ticket is:
 *  - high-entropy random, held only in server memory (a stateless JWT could not
 *    enforce single-use);
 *  - deleted synchronously on the FIRST upgrade attempt (reuse → refusal);
 *  - bound to a WS route SCOPE at mint time — a ticket minted for `/ws` cannot
 *    be replayed against a more-privileged `/ws/terminal/*` route.
