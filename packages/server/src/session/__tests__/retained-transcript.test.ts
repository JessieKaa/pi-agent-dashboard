/**
 * The READ half of D12 — serving back a remote transcript this dashboard
 * already retained.
 *
 * The write half shipped; `RemoteTranscriptStore.read()` had no caller and no
 * route, so the bytes were on disk and nothing could show them. Two properties
 * decide whether adding that caller is safe:
 *
 *   - **The read is addressed by session id, never by path.** It is the same
 *     rule the bridge enforces on the wire (`decideTranscriptRequest`), applied
 *     to the dashboard's own route, from the SAME source. A route that accepted
 *     a path would be a file-read oracle wearing a transcript's clothes.
 *   - **It serves REMOTE-origin sessions only.** A local session already has a
 *     read path through its own `.jsonl`; letting this route answer for one
 *     would make it a second, less-confined way to reach local files (#E15).
 *
 * And one correctness property: a partial transfer must not read back as the
 * whole conversation, nor as an empty one.
 *
 * Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.
 * See change: serve-retained-remote-transcripts.
