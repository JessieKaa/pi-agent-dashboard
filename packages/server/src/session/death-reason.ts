/**
 * Best-effort classification of an involuntary death from the recorded `pid`.
 *
 * Involuntary termination causes and a severed network link are identical from
 * the server's position: silence. The probe can only distinguish "the process is
 * gone" from "we could not tell", and NEVER names a signal or a kill mechanism
 * (spec: "Process-liveness classification SHALL NOT overclaim").
 *
 * `pid` is self-reported by the bridge and optional, and operating systems
 * recycle pids. A live probe is therefore NOT evidence of a live pi: a recycled
 * pid makes a dead process probe as alive, so a live probe downgrades to
 * `unknown` rather than claiming the process persists. An unprobeable pid
 * (EPERM, no pid) is likewise `unknown`.
 *
 * A REMOTE-origin session's pid lives in ANOTHER host's PID namespace, so a
 * local probe of it is meaningless — an ESRCH would assert `process_gone` about
 * a process this host cannot see (a running remote pi behind a dropped tunnel
 * is the common case). Remote origin therefore downgrades to `unknown` WITHOUT
 * probing. See change: stop-discarding-known-session-state (design D1, task 4.10).
