/**
 * Serving back a remote transcript this dashboard already retained.
 *
 * `add-pi-gateway-transport-identity` shipped the acquisition half: a joining
 * bridge streams `transcript_chunk` frames and `RemoteTranscriptStore` persists
 * them. The read half was deferred, so the data sat on disk with no caller and
 * no route — a user joining a remote dashboard saw a session whose history
 * existed on the server and rendered empty.
 *
 * Two boundaries make adding that caller safe, and they are enforced in this
 * order deliberately:
 *
 *   1. **No path on the wire.** Enforced by the SAME `decideTranscriptRequest`
 *      the bridge applies to an inbound `transcript_request` — one rule, one
 *      source, because a duplicated security rule drifts and the copy that
 *      drifts is the one nobody is reading. Sessions are addressed by id only.
 *   2. **Remote-origin only** (D13). A local session already has a read path
 *      through its own `.jsonl`; answering for one here would make this a
 *      second, less-confined road to local files — the #E15 shape.
 *
 * Shape first, subject second, matching the bridge guard exactly: one rule from
 * one source means the same probe gets the same refusal at both ends. (Origin
 * is not itself a secret — `originDeviceId` rides `GET /api/sessions` — so the
 * ordering is rule-consistency, not concealment.)
 *
 * See change: serve-retained-remote-transcripts (tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3).
