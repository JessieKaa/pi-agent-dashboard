# browser-gateway-decomposition Specification

## Purpose

Splits the server's browser-facing WebSocket gateway into per-concern handlers (subscription, session actions, session meta, terminal, directory) with defined boundaries. Also carries the gateway's efficiency and safety contracts: lazy per-session subscription, a single on-connect snapshot instead of a per-session loop, one payload serialization per broadcast fan-out, and handler exceptions logged rather than silently swallowed.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Subscription handler extraction
browser-gateway.ts SHALL delegate `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` message handling (including event replay and lazy session loading) to a subscription handler module.

#### Scenario: Subscribe replays events from memory
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes to a session with events in memory
- **THEN** the subscription handler replays events in batches and sends pending UI requests

#### Scenario: Subscribe lazy-loads ended sessions
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes to an ended session not in memory
- **THEN** the subscription handler loads events from disk via DirectoryService and broadcasts them

#### Scenario: Subscribe with lastSeq returns delta
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with `lastSeq: 50` and the server has events up to seq 100
- **THEN** the subscription handler SHALL replay only events with seq 51–100

#### Scenario: Subscribe with stale lastSeq triggers reset
- **WHEN** a browser subscribes with `lastSeq: 500` but server max seq is 10
- **THEN** the subscription handler SHALL send `session_state_reset` to the subscribing WebSocket and replay all events from seq 1

### Requirement: Session action handler extraction
browser-gateway.ts SHALL delegate action messages (`send_prompt`, `abort`, `resume_session`, `spawn_session`, `shutdown`, `flow_control`) to a session action handler module.

#### Scenario: Send prompt forwards to pi gateway
- **WHEN** browser sends a send_prompt for an active session
- **THEN** the session action handler forwards to piGateway

#### Scenario: Send prompt to ended session triggers auto-resume
- **WHEN** browser sends a send_prompt for an ended session
- **THEN** the session action handler queues the prompt and spawns a pi process to continue

### Requirement: Session meta handler extraction
browser-gateway.ts SHALL delegate metadata messages (`rename_session`, `archive_session`, `unarchive_session`, `attach_proposal`, `detach_proposal`, `fetch_content`, `list_sessions`) to a session meta handler module.

#### Scenario: Rename broadcasts update
- **WHEN** browser sends rename_session
- **THEN** the meta handler updates session manager, broadcasts to all browsers, and forwards to extension

### Requirement: Terminal handler extraction
browser-gateway.ts SHALL delegate terminal messages (`create_terminal`, `kill_terminal`, `rename_terminal`) to a terminal handler module.

#### Scenario: Create terminal spawns and broadcasts
- **WHEN** browser sends create_terminal
- **THEN** the terminal handler spawns a PTY, inserts into session order, and broadcasts terminal_added

### Requirement: Directory handler extraction
browser-gateway.ts SHALL delegate directory/preference messages (`pin_directory`, `unpin_directory`, `reorder_pinned_dirs`, `reorder_sessions`, `openspec_refresh`, `openspec_bulk_archive`, `extension_ui_response`, `request_commands`, `list_files`, `request_models`, `set_model`, `set_thinking_level`) to a directory handler module.

#### Scenario: Pin directory triggers discovery
- **WHEN** browser sends pin_directory
- **THEN** the directory handler resolves the path, persists the pin, triggers session discovery, and broadcasts the update

### Requirement: Lazy session subscription
The browser client SHALL NOT auto-subscribe to all active sessions on connect. Instead, it SHALL subscribe only to the currently selected/viewed session. Sidebar session cards SHALL rely on `session_added` and `session_updated` broadcasts for metadata display.

#### Scenario: Browser connects with no session selected
- **WHEN** a browser client connects and no session is selected
- **THEN** the client SHALL NOT send any `subscribe` messages
- **AND** the sidebar SHALL display session cards using metadata from `session_added` messages

#### Scenario: User selects a session
- **WHEN** the user navigates to session "s1"
- **THEN** the client SHALL send `subscribe { sessionId: "s1", lastSeq: <maxSeq or 0> }`

#### Scenario: Browser reconnects with session selected
- **WHEN** the browser WebSocket reconnects and session "s1" was selected
- **THEN** the client SHALL re-subscribe to "s1" with `lastSeq` from its seq tracker
- **AND** the client SHALL NOT subscribe to other active sessions

#### Scenario: session_added for active session does not trigger subscribe
- **WHEN** the browser receives `session_added` for a new active session
- **THEN** the client SHALL NOT auto-subscribe to that session
- **AND** the sidebar card SHALL display using the session metadata from the message

### Requirement: Handler exceptions are logged, not silently swallowed

The browser-gateway WebSocket message dispatcher SHALL distinguish between two failure modes:

1. A frame that is not valid JSON (malformed input). This MAY be silently dropped.
2. An exception thrown by an individual message handler while processing a parsed message. This SHALL be caught and logged with enough context to diagnose the failure. It SHALL NOT be silently swallowed.

The catch-all around the message-type `switch` that previously absorbed all exceptions SHALL be scoped so that only `JSON.parse` errors produce no log output. Handler exceptions SHALL emit a log line that includes the message type and the underlying error.

#### Scenario: Malformed JSON frame is silently dropped
- **WHEN** a browser WebSocket client sends a frame whose payload is not valid JSON
- **THEN** the dispatcher SHALL NOT throw
- **AND** the dispatcher SHALL NOT emit a handler-error log line

#### Scenario: Handler throws an exception during dispatch
- **WHEN** a browser WebSocket client sends a well-formed message of type `<T>`
- **AND** the handler for type `<T>` throws an error `E`
- **THEN** the dispatcher SHALL log an error line that includes the literal string `[browser-gw] handler error`, the message type `<T>`, and the error `E`
- **AND** the dispatcher SHALL remain running and continue to accept subsequent messages

#### Scenario: create_terminal handler throws because node-pty fails to spawn
- **WHEN** a browser sends `{ type: "create_terminal", cwd: "..." }`
- **AND** `terminalManager.spawn` throws (e.g. `posix_spawnp failed.`)
- **THEN** the dispatcher SHALL log an error containing `[browser-gw] handler error`, `type=create_terminal`, and the underlying error text
- **AND** the WebSocket connection SHALL remain open

### Requirement: On-connect snapshot replaces per-session loop

On every browser WebSocket connect, the browser gateway SHALL emit exactly one `sessions_snapshot` message containing every non-ended session, the `ended` sessions that fall inside the snapshot window (the newest 120 ended sessions overall by end time, plus the first 3 of the ended sequence per session group that has a non-ended session or is pinned), and the per-cwd session orders projected through the same window (an order SHALL NOT reference an id absent from the snapshot's `sessions`). The snapshot SHALL carry `endedTotals`, the count of ended sessions per session group regardless of window, for every group that has at least one ended session. Throughout this requirement "session group" / the `cwd` keys of `orders` and `endedTotals` mean the session group key the sidebar already groups and orders by (pinned directory, else worktree main path, else the session cwd). Snapshot rows SHALL omit `notifyLog` (it is replayed on subscribe). It SHALL NOT emit per-session `session_added` messages or per-cwd `sessions_reordered` messages as part of the on-connect bootstrap.

The snapshot SHALL be the last frame of the connect bootstrap; every other connect-bootstrap frame (`pinned_dirs_updated`, `workspaces_updated`, `favorite_models_updated`, `display_prefs_updated`, `reachability_updated`, per-cwd `openspec_update`, per-cwd `git_head_update`, `terminal_added`) SHALL be sent before it.

The serialized snapshot SHALL NOT exceed 400 KB for a registry of at most 25 non-ended sessions and 4,000 ended sessions spread across 400 groups with 20 of them pinned, with rows shaped like today's measured sessions.

Live updates after the snapshot SHALL continue to use the existing incremental `session_added`, `session_updated`, `session_removed`, and `sessions_reordered` messages. A live `sessions_reordered` SHALL be projected through the same window as the snapshot.

#### Scenario: Single snapshot per connection
- **WHEN** a new browser WebSocket connection is established
- **THEN** the gateway SHALL send exactly one message of type `sessions_snapshot` to that socket before any other session-registry-related send
- **AND** the gateway SHALL NOT iterate `sessionManager.listAll()` to send per-session `session_added` for that bootstrap
- **AND** the gateway SHALL NOT iterate `sessionOrderManager.getAllOrders()` to send per-cwd `sessions_reordered` for that bootstrap

#### Scenario: Live update after snapshot uses incremental message
- **WHEN** a bridge registers a new session after the snapshot has been sent on that connection
- **THEN** the gateway SHALL emit the incremental `session_added` for that session as before, NOT another snapshot

#### Scenario: Other on-connect sends preserved
- **WHEN** the gateway sends the snapshot on connect
- **THEN** the on-connect sends for `pinned_dirs_updated`, `openspec_update`, `git_head_update`, and `terminal_added` SHALL still be emitted
- **AND** each of them SHALL be sent before `sessions_snapshot` on that socket

#### Scenario: Snapshot is windowed and self-consistent
- **GIVEN** a cwd with 3 non-ended sessions and 500 ended sessions, and a window smaller than 500
- **WHEN** a browser connects
- **THEN** `sessions` SHALL contain all 3 non-ended sessions and only the windowed ended ones
- **AND** every id in `orders[cwd]` SHALL be present in `sessions`
- **AND** `endedTotals[cwd]` SHALL equal 500
- **AND** no row in `sessions` SHALL carry a `notifyLog` field

#### Scenario: Snapshot byte bound
- **GIVEN** a synthetic registry of 25 non-ended and 4,000 ended sessions across 400 groups (20 pinned), each row populated to today's measured field shape
- **WHEN** the snapshot is serialized
- **THEN** its length SHALL be at most 400 KB

#### Scenario: Live reorder is windowed
- **GIVEN** a cwd whose persisted order includes ended ids outside the window
- **WHEN** a `sessions_reordered` is broadcast for that cwd
- **THEN** the broadcast order SHALL contain only ids that a fresh snapshot would contain

### Requirement: Broadcast serializes payload once per fan-out

When broadcasting a message to all subscribed browser sockets, the gateway SHALL serialize the payload **exactly once** per `broadcast()` call and send the same serialized frame to every open socket, rather than re-serializing per recipient. This bounds per-broadcast CPU at O(payload) instead of O(payload × subscribers), which matters for large recurring payloads such as `openspec_update` for repositories with many changes.

Existing back-pressure and liveness guards SHALL be preserved: a socket whose `readyState` is not `OPEN` SHALL be skipped, and a socket whose `bufferedAmount` exceeds `MAX_WS_BUFFER` (when the limit is non-zero) SHALL be skipped.

#### Scenario: Single serialization regardless of subscriber count
- **WHEN** `broadcast(msg)` is called with three subscribed open sockets
- **THEN** the payload SHALL be serialized once
- **AND** each of the three sockets SHALL receive an identical frame

#### Scenario: Back-pressure drop still applies after serialize-once
- **WHEN** one subscribed socket has `bufferedAmount` greater than `MAX_WS_BUFFER` and `MAX_WS_BUFFER` is non-zero
- **THEN** that socket SHALL NOT receive the frame
- **AND** the other open sockets SHALL still receive the single serialized frame

#### Scenario: Closed socket skipped
- **WHEN** a subscribed socket's `readyState` is not `OPEN`
- **THEN** that socket SHALL be skipped without error and the remaining open sockets SHALL receive the frame
