# Git Context

## Purpose

Detect and propagate per-session git context — branch, detached HEAD SHA, worktree identity, remote URL, PR number, hosting-platform links, worktree base ref, cwd-missing state, and the persistent is-git-repo tri-state — from the bridge extension through the session protocol into `DashboardSession` and `.meta.json`, so the dashboard can render branch/PR affordances and gate worktree actions accurately across live, cold, and restarted sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Git branch detection
The bridge extension SHALL detect the current git branch by running `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` in the session's `cwd`. If the command fails (not a git repo), the branch SHALL be `undefined`. When in detached HEAD state, the extension SHALL detect the short commit SHA via `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.

In the same `gatherGitInfo` pass, the extension SHALL determine worktree identity via the shared checkout-root resolution (`git-checkout-root-resolution`). The cwd SHALL be classified as a worktree when it is a linked worktree (`git rev-parse --git-dir` differs from `git rev-parse --git-common-dir`) AND a main checkout resolves for it. The extension SHALL NOT classify by comparing `--git-common-dir` against `--show-toplevel`, and SHALL NOT derive `mainPath` as the parent of `--git-common-dir`: that comparison reports a submodule as a worktree, and that derivation names a real checkout only when the git dir happens to sit inside one. The resolver returns a repository-local `core.worktree` value VERBATIM and does not judge it, so a resolved main checkout containing an exact `.git` path SEGMENT SHALL be treated as no worktree: the extension is a DISPLAY consumer, and the safe response is to omit `gitWorktree` rather than put a git-internal path on the wire.

#### Scenario: Resolved main checkout inside a git directory
- **GIVEN** a linked worktree whose repository-local `core.worktree` names a path containing a `.git` segment
- **WHEN** the extension gathers git info for that cwd
- **THEN** the extension SHALL emit `gitWorktree: undefined` (or omit the field)
- **AND** SHALL NOT emit the git-internal path as `mainPath`

#### Scenario: Session in a git repository
- **WHEN** the extension gathers git info in a directory that is a git repository
- **THEN** the extension SHALL detect the current branch name

#### Scenario: Session not in a git repository
- **WHEN** the extension gathers git info in a directory that is not a git repository
- **THEN** the branch SHALL be `undefined` and no git info SHALL be sent

#### Scenario: Detached HEAD
- **WHEN** the git repository is in a detached HEAD state
- **THEN** `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns `"HEAD"`
- **AND** the extension SHALL run `git rev-parse --short HEAD` to get the short commit SHA
- **AND** the branch SHALL be the short SHA (e.g., `"abc1234"`)
- **AND** no branch link SHALL be generated

#### Scenario: Session in main repo checkout
- **WHEN** the cwd is not a linked worktree (its `--git-dir` equals its `--git-common-dir`)
- **THEN** the extension SHALL emit `gitWorktree: undefined` (or omit the field) on the gathered info
- **AND** this SHALL hold for a submodule checkout, a `--separate-git-dir` checkout, and a bare repository alike

#### Scenario: Session in a git worktree
- **WHEN** the cwd is a linked worktree and a main checkout resolves for it
- **THEN** the extension SHALL emit `gitWorktree: { mainPath, name }`
- **AND** `mainPath` SHALL be the resolved main checkout — the main working tree for an ordinary worktree, and the submodule's own checkout for a worktree of a submodule
- **AND** `mainPath` SHALL NOT be the parent of `--git-common-dir` when that parent is not a working tree
- **AND** `name` SHALL be the basename of the worktree's own ROOT (`thisCheckout`), NOT of the request cwd, which may be a subdirectory of the worktree

#### Scenario: Worktree detection failure
- **WHEN** either `rev-parse` invocation fails (e.g., insufficient git version, permission)
- **THEN** the extension SHALL fall through to `gitWorktree: undefined`
- **AND** SHALL NOT block the branch / remote / PR detection that follows

### Requirement: Worktree identity propagation through session protocol
The bridge SHALL include the `gitWorktree` object on `git_info_update` payloads when the cwd is a worktree — the first such update is sent immediately after `session_register`, so the server learns worktree identity within the same registration handshake. The server SHALL store `gitWorktree` on `DashboardSession` and forward it in `session_added` / `session_updated` browser messages. The field SHALL be optional; clients receiving an older bridge MUST treat its absence as "not a worktree".

Once a session's worktree parentage has been resolved, it SHALL be treated as immutable while the session's cwd is unchanged. A re-register with the SAME cwd SHALL carry the in-memory `gitWorktree` over (so a server restart or bridge reconnect during the removal window cannot re-open the clear); a re-register with a DIFFERENT cwd SHALL discard it and start from "unresolved". A `git_info_update` carrying `gitWorktree: null` for a session whose `gitWorktree` is already set means the worktree directory was removed underneath the still-running session (e.g. `git worktree remove` executed from inside it), NOT that the session moved to a plain checkout; the server SHALL keep the existing parentage in that case. A `null` for a session with no parentage set SHALL clear as before.

#### Scenario: Worktree session register
- **WHEN** a bridge whose cwd is a worktree registers a session
- **THEN** the `git_info_update` that immediately follows `session_register` SHALL include `gitWorktree: { mainPath, name }`

#### Scenario: Non-worktree session register
- **WHEN** a bridge whose cwd is a main checkout registers a session
- **THEN** the `gitWorktree` field SHALL be absent from the register payload (not present as `null`)

#### Scenario: Reattach in the same cwd preserves parentage
- **WHEN** a session with `gitWorktree` set re-registers (server restart, bridge reconnect, resume) with the same `cwd`
- **THEN** the session's `gitWorktree` SHALL be unchanged after registration
- **AND** a subsequent `git_info_update { gitWorktree: null }` SHALL leave it unchanged

#### Scenario: Reattach in a different cwd resets parentage
- **WHEN** a session with `gitWorktree` set re-registers with a different `cwd`
- **THEN** `gitWorktree` SHALL be absent after registration until the bridge reports it again

#### Scenario: Live worktree state update
- **WHEN** a bridge's `gitWorktree` value changes from one worktree object to another (rare; e.g., user runs `git worktree repair`)
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL emit a `git_info_update` carrying the new value
- **AND** the server SHALL broadcast `session_updated` with the new `gitWorktree`

#### Scenario: Worktree removed underneath a live session
- **WHEN** a session has `gitWorktree = { mainPath: "/repo", name: "feat-x" }` and `cwd = "/repo/.worktrees/feat-x"`
- **AND** a `git_info_update` arrives with `gitWorktree: null`
- **THEN** the server SHALL keep `gitWorktree = { mainPath: "/repo", name: "feat-x" }`
- **AND** the session SHALL still be marked as having reported worktree state
- **AND** the session's persisted `.meta.json` SHALL retain `gitWorktree.mainPath` / `gitWorktree.name` when the session ends

#### Scenario: Null clears when no parentage was set
- **WHEN** a session has no `gitWorktree`
- **AND** a `git_info_update` arrives with `gitWorktree: null`
- **THEN** `gitWorktree` SHALL remain absent
- **AND** the session SHALL be marked as having reported worktree state

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility with older bridges
- **WHEN** a client receives a session payload without the `gitWorktree` field
- **THEN** the client SHALL treat the session as a plain checkout (no worktree pill, no group collapse)

### Requirement: Worktree base ref persisted in session meta
When a session is spawned by the dashboard via the worktree dialog (post `POST /api/git/worktree`), the server SHALL persist the base ref used to create the worktree into the session's `.meta.json` as `gitWorktreeBase: string`. Sessions spawned by any other channel (CLI `pi`, manual `git worktree add`, etc.) SHALL NOT have this field.

The server SHALL include `gitWorktree.base` on browser-facing session payloads when both:
- `session.gitWorktree` is present (cwd is a worktree), AND
- `gitWorktreeBase` is set in `.meta.json` for this session.

#### Scenario: Dialog-spawned worktree session
- **WHEN** the dashboard spawns a session via the worktree dialog with `base: "develop"`
- **THEN** the session's `.meta.json` SHALL contain `gitWorktreeBase: "develop"`
- **AND** subsequent `session_added` payloads SHALL include `gitWorktree: { mainPath, name, base: "develop" }`

#### Scenario: Session in worktree spawned by other means
- **WHEN** a session is registered for a worktree cwd but no `gitWorktreeBase` exists in `.meta.json`
- **THEN** the `gitWorktree` object SHALL include `mainPath` and `name` only (no `base`)

### Requirement: Git remote URL detection
The extension SHALL detect the remote URL by running `git remote get-url origin` in the session's `cwd`. If the command fails (no origin remote), the remote URL SHALL be `undefined`.

#### Scenario: SSH remote URL
- **WHEN** the origin remote URL is in SSH format (e.g., `git@github.com:user/repo.git`)
- **THEN** the extension SHALL parse it to extract the host, user, and repo

#### Scenario: HTTPS remote URL
- **WHEN** the origin remote URL is in HTTPS format (e.g., `https://github.com/user/repo.git`)
- **THEN** the extension SHALL parse it to extract the host, user, and repo

#### Scenario: No origin remote
- **WHEN** the repository has no "origin" remote configured
- **THEN** the remote URL SHALL be `undefined` and no links SHALL be generated

### Requirement: PR number detection
The extension SHALL attempt to detect the current PR/MR number using platform-specific CLI tools. Detection SHALL be best-effort and fail silently.

#### Scenario: GitHub PR detected via gh CLI
- **WHEN** `gh` CLI is available and the current branch has an open PR
- **THEN** the extension SHALL detect the PR number

#### Scenario: CLI tool not available
- **WHEN** the platform CLI tool (gh, glab, etc.) is not installed
- **THEN** the PR number SHALL be `undefined` and no PR link SHALL be generated

### Requirement: Hosting platform link building
The extension SHALL build clickable URLs for the git branch and PR based on the detected hosting platform.

Supported platforms and their URL patterns:
- **GitHub**: branch → `/tree/{branch}`, PR → `/pull/{number}`
- **GitLab**: branch → `/-/tree/{branch}`, MR → `/-/merge_requests/{number}`
- **Bitbucket**: branch → `/src/{branch}`, PR → `/pull-requests/{number}`
- **Gitea**: branch → `/src/branch/{branch}`, PR → `/pulls/{number}`
- **Codeberg**: branch → `/src/branch/{branch}`, PR → `/pulls/{number}`
- **SourceHut**: branch → `/tree/{branch}`, patches → `/patches/{number}`

#### Scenario: GitHub repository with PR
- **WHEN** the remote is `git@github.com:user/repo.git`, branch is `feat/foo`, PR is #42
- **THEN** the branch URL SHALL be `https://github.com/user/repo/tree/feat%2Ffoo` and PR URL SHALL be `https://github.com/user/repo/pull/42`

#### Scenario: GitLab repository
- **WHEN** the remote is `https://gitlab.com/user/repo.git` and branch is `main`
- **THEN** the branch URL SHALL be `https://gitlab.com/user/repo/-/tree/main`

#### Scenario: Unknown hosting platform
- **WHEN** the remote host does not match any known platform
- **THEN** no URLs SHALL be generated and branch/PR SHALL be shown as plain text

#### Scenario: Branch with special characters
- **WHEN** the branch name contains `/` or other URL-unsafe characters
- **THEN** the branch name SHALL be URL-encoded in the generated URL

### Requirement: Periodic git info refresh
The extension SHALL poll git info every 30 seconds and send a `git_info_update` message to the server only when the branch or PR number has changed since the last update.

#### Scenario: Branch changes during session
- **WHEN** the user checks out a different branch during a session
- **THEN** the next 30-second poll SHALL detect the change and send updated git info

#### Scenario: No change since last poll
- **WHEN** git info has not changed since the last update
- **THEN** the extension SHALL NOT send a `git_info_update` message

#### Scenario: Initial git info
- **WHEN** a session is registered
- **THEN** the extension SHALL send git info immediately after registration, then poll every 30 seconds

### Requirement: cwdMissing flag on DashboardSession
`DashboardSession` SHALL carry an optional `cwdMissing?: boolean` field set by any of three probe sites: (1) the bridge's 30 s VCS tick, (2) the server's session scanner on boot, (3) the `worktree/remove` lifecycle endpoint. The field is purely computed and SHALL NOT be persisted.

#### Scenario: Bridge probe flips on deletion
- **WHEN** the bridge's 30 s tick discovers `existsSync(ctx.cwd) === false` for the first time
- **THEN** the bridge SHALL send `{ type: "cwd_missing", sessionId }` to the server
- **AND** the server SHALL stamp `cwdMissing: true` and broadcast `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Scanner re-probes ended sessions
- **WHEN** the server's session scanner enumerates an ended session whose `cwd` no longer exists on disk
- **THEN** the scanner SHALL stamp `cwdMissing: true` on the in-memory `DashboardSession` before adding it to the manager

#### Scenario: Optimistic stamp on lifecycle remove
- **WHEN** `POST /api/git/worktree/remove` succeeds
- **THEN** every session whose `cwd` was inside the removed path SHALL receive `cwdMissing: true` via `session_updated`

#### Scenario: Backward compatibility with older bridges
- **WHEN** a bridge older than this change is connected
- **THEN** the field SHALL remain `undefined` for every session managed by that bridge
- **AND** the client SHALL treat `undefined` as "not missing"

### Requirement: Stable error code cwd_missing
The server's spawn / resume preflight SHALL return error `code: "cwd_missing"` (replacing the older `cwd_invalid`) when the session's cwd no longer exists. For one release the response envelope SHALL include both keys to preserve compatibility with older clients reading `cwd_invalid`.

#### Scenario: Resume fails with cwd_missing
- **WHEN** a client attempts to resume a session whose cwd has been deleted
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond with `{ success: false, error: "cwd_missing", stderr: "<path>" }`

### Requirement: Persistent is-git-repo tri-state
The system SHALL expose a per-session `isGitRepo` tri-state describing whether the session's cwd is a git repository, independent of branch-info arrival. The value SHALL be one of: `true` (confirmed git repo), `false` (confirmed non-git), or `undefined` (unknown — probe inconclusive or legacy session).

The bridge SHALL compute `isGitRepo` from `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree` (the `git.isGitRepo()` `Result`): a successful result SHALL yield its boolean value; a process exit with code `128` (git ran and definitively reported "not a repository") SHALL yield `false`; any other failure (spawn error such as missing git binary, timeout, or termination signal) SHALL yield `undefined`. A failed or timed-out probe SHALL NEVER yield `false` — inconclusive is not negative.

The bridge SHALL include `isGitRepo` on the `session_register` payload (computed synchronously at register time, so browsers receive it without the race that affects `git_info_update`) and MAY refresh it on `git_info_update`. The field SHALL be optional; a client or server receiving an older bridge MUST treat its absence as `undefined` (unknown).

The server SHALL store `isGitRepo` on `DashboardSession`, forward it in `session_added` / `session_updated` browser messages, and persist it into the session's `.meta.json` as `isGitRepo: boolean`. On cold start, `sessionFromMeta` SHALL restore `meta.isGitRepo` so ended/cold sessions in a git repo retain a truthy signal across server restarts without a live bridge.

#### Scenario: Confirmed git repo on register
- **WHEN** the bridge registers a session whose cwd is inside a git work tree
- **THEN** the `session_register` payload SHALL include `isGitRepo: true`
- **AND** the server SHALL persist `isGitRepo: true` to the session's `.meta.json`

#### Scenario: Confirmed non-git on register
- **WHEN** the bridge registers a session whose cwd is not a git repository (git exits `128`)
- **THEN** the `session_register` payload SHALL include `isGitRepo: false`

#### Scenario: Inconclusive probe yields unknown, never false
- **WHEN** the git probe fails to run or times out (missing binary, permission error, ≥15s timeout, killed by signal)
- **THEN** `isGitRepo` SHALL be `undefined`
- **AND** SHALL NOT be reported as `false`

#### Scenario: Survives server restart for cold sessions
- **WHEN** the server restarts and rebuilds an ended session from `.meta.json` where `meta.isGitRepo === true`, with no live bridge reconnected
- **THEN** the restored `DashboardSession.isGitRepo` SHALL be `true`

#### Scenario: Legacy bridge / session
- **WHEN** a session is registered by a bridge that does not send `isGitRepo`, or restored from a `.meta.json` lacking the field
- **THEN** `DashboardSession.isGitRepo` SHALL be `undefined`
