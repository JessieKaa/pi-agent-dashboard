# provider-quota-surfacing Specification

## Purpose
Surface per-account provider subscription quota (Codex, Copilot, OpenRouter,
Synthetic, Z.ai, OpenCode Go, Kimi) in the dashboard's cross-session web UI, so
operators can see how much subscription budget remains and whether usage is
outrunning the reset window — server-fetched, disabled by default, ToS-gated,
per-provider, Anthropic excluded, tokens never leaving the server.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Quota tracking SHALL be disabled by default, opt-in, per-provider, ToS-gated
The plugin MAY be bundled but SHALL be **disabled by default** (plugin activation
UI). Beyond activation it SHALL require a one-time Terms-of-Service acknowledgement
AND per-provider enablement (`plugins.quota.providers.<id>.enabled`, off by
default). None of activation, ack, or per-provider enable SHALL be turned on by
migration or upgrade. No subscription-quota endpoint call SHALL occur unless the
plugin is enabled AND acknowledged AND that provider is enabled.

#### Scenario: Disabled plugin fetches nothing
- **WHEN** the plugin is bundled but not enabled
- **THEN** the server entry SHALL make no quota endpoint call and expose no quota

#### Scenario: Per-provider gate
- **WHEN** the plugin is enabled, the ToS is acknowledged, and `openai-codex` is
  enabled but `github-copilot` is not
- **THEN** the server SHALL fetch Codex quota and SHALL NOT fetch Copilot quota

#### Scenario: Disable clears cached quota
- **WHEN** a previously-enabled provider is disabled
- **THEN** the server SHALL stop fetching it and clear its cached quota

### Requirement: Server SHALL resolve credentials via the host auth abstraction
The server entry SHALL obtain provider credentials through the dashboard's own auth
abstraction (`InternalAuthStorage` / `provider-auth-storage.ts`), NOT by reading a
hardcoded `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` path. It SHALL adapt that resolver to the
`AuthStorage` shape `@latentminds/pi-quotas` consumes.

#### Scenario: No hardcoded path
- **WHEN** the server entry resolves a provider token
- **THEN** it SHALL call the host auth abstraction and SHALL NOT open the auth.json
  file directly

### Requirement: Anthropic SHALL be excluded from the subscription tracker
The plugin SHALL NOT attempt a subscription-quota fetch for Anthropic (pi blocks
Claude subscription inference server-side; API-key sessions return
`not_applicable`).

#### Scenario: Anthropic skipped
- **WHEN** the enabled provider set includes Anthropic
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT call the Anthropic quota endpoint

### Requirement: Server SHALL fetch quota safely and expose it via an endpoint
When gated on, the server SHALL fetch via `@latentminds/pi-quotas` (its per-provider
TTL cache), suppress `not_applicable`, validate/clamp windows, and expose the result
at `GET /api/quota` as `{ providers: [{ provider, windows[] }] }`, where each window
carries `label`, `usedPercent` (0..100), `resetsAt`, and `windowSeconds`. Quota
SHALL NOT be persisted to the durable event store.

#### Scenario: Normalized quota exposed
- **WHEN** an enabled non-Anthropic OAuth provider returns usage
- **THEN** `GET /api/quota` SHALL include that provider's normalized windows incl.
  `windowSeconds`

#### Scenario: API-key session omitted
- **WHEN** a provider credential is a direct API key (`not_applicable`)
- **THEN** that provider SHALL be omitted from `/api/quota` with no error

### Requirement: Tokens SHALL never leave the server
The server SHALL expose and log only quota-derived fields. OAuth access/refresh
tokens and API keys SHALL NOT appear in `/api/quota`, any broadcast, or any log line
(error objects, URLs, and headers redacted).

#### Scenario: No secret in output or logs
- **WHEN** quota is exposed or a fetch error is logged
- **THEN** no substring of any provider token/key SHALL appear in the output or log

### Requirement: Client SHALL render a per-provider quota widget and degrade gracefully
The client entry SHALL claim the `composer-context-group` slot and render a `Quota` context group holding one chip per provider present in `/api/quota` `providers[]` with at least one window, and SHALL claim `settings-section` for the ToS gate + master enable + per-provider toggles. Each chip SHALL show the provider name followed by **every** window inline as `<window label> <pace bar> <used %>`, with the bar fill coloured by pace severity and a `now` tick. When the provider is flagged `stale` by the server the chip SHALL render its bars muted and append a dashed `not live` tag. When no provider has windows the client SHALL render nothing — no chip, no group, no note, no error. The label, note and chip accessible names SHALL be localized like the plugin's other strings.

When the filtered provider list (entries in `/api/quota` `providers[]` with at least one window) is non-empty, the session's model provider is the prefix of `session.model` before the first `/` (undefined when `session.model` is undefined or has no `/`). The chip matching that provider SHALL render first with an accent ring and full opacity; other chips SHALL follow at reduced opacity. The chip SHALL NOT repeat the model id. When the provider is defined but absent from `providers[]`, a non-interactive dashed note `<model id> · no quota` (model id = the part after the first `/`) SHALL precede the chips, all of which SHALL render un-ringed at reduced opacity. When the provider is undefined, no chip SHALL be ringed or dimmed and no note SHALL render. Emphasis SHALL be derived on every render from the session, so a model change re-orders the chips without user action.

#### Scenario: Widget renders from /api/quota
- **WHEN** `/api/quota` returns a provider with windows
- **THEN** the client SHALL render that provider's chip in the `Quota` context group with one labelled pace bar per window, each fill coloured by pace severity

#### Scenario: No data shows no widget
- **WHEN** `/api/quota` returns no providers (disabled or none enabled)
- **THEN** the client SHALL render no quota chip, no `Quota` group and no error

#### Scenario: Session provider chip leads with ring
- **WHEN** `session.model` is `anthropic/claude-x` and `/api/quota` returns `anthropic` and `openai-codex`
- **THEN** the `anthropic` chip SHALL render first with the accent ring, followed by the dimmed `openai-codex` chip

#### Scenario: Session provider without quota shows a note
- **WHEN** `session.model` is `google-vertex/gemini-x` and `/api/quota` returns only `anthropic`
- **THEN** a dashed non-interactive note `gemini-x · no quota` SHALL precede the un-ringed, dimmed `anthropic` chip

#### Scenario: Model switch moves the ring
- **WHEN** the session's model changes from `anthropic/…` to `openai-codex/…`
- **THEN** the `openai-codex` chip SHALL become first and ringed on the next render, with no user interaction

#### Scenario: Model without provider prefix gets no emphasis
- **WHEN** `session.model` is `my-alias` (no `/`) and `/api/quota` returns `anthropic`
- **THEN** the `anthropic` chip SHALL render un-ringed and no note SHALL render

#### Scenario: Stale provider is tagged
- **WHEN** `/api/quota` returns a provider with `stale: true`
- **THEN** the chip SHALL render its bars muted and append a `not live` tag

### Requirement: Client SHALL warn when usage outruns elapsed time, with safe math
The client SHALL derive pace per window using consistent units
(`secondsToReset = (Date.parse(resetsAt) − now) / 1000`;
`elapsedRaw = (windowSeconds − secondsToReset) / windowSeconds`;
`projected = usedPercent / min(elapsedRaw, 1)`) and SHALL warn when
`projected ≥ 100`. It SHALL return the guarded state BEFORE any division:
`windowSeconds ≤ 0` or non-finite → "pace unavailable"; non-finite
`Date.parse(resetsAt)` → "pace unavailable"; `elapsedRaw ≤ EPS` → "pace
unavailable"; `secondsToReset ≤ 0` → stale (grey, not "on pace"). It SHALL never
emit `Infinity`/`NaN` or a spurious warning.

#### Scenario: Just-reset window does not explode
- **WHEN** a window has just reset (`elapsedRaw ≤ EPS`)
- **THEN** the client SHALL render "pace unavailable" and produce no `Infinity`/`NaN`
  or warning

#### Scenario: Stale reset is not shown as on pace
- **WHEN** `resetsAt` is in the past (`secondsToReset ≤ 0`)
- **THEN** the window SHALL render greyed/stale and SHALL NOT report "on pace"

#### Scenario: Pace tick marks now
- **WHEN** a window is rendered (slider or dialog)
- **THEN** a `now` tick SHALL sit at `elapsed × 100`% of the track

### Requirement: Clicking a slider SHALL open the shared Dialog primitive with a provider selector
Clicking a provider chip SHALL open the dashboard's shared `Dialog` primitive
(`useUiPrimitive(UI_PRIMITIVE_KEYS.dialog)`), pre-selected to that provider, with a
selector to switch provider or show all. The plugin SHALL NOT hand-roll a modal. The
`no quota` note SHALL NOT be clickable.

#### Scenario: Click opens dialog pre-selected to the provider
- **WHEN** the user clicks the Codex chip
- **THEN** the shared `Dialog` SHALL open centered and modal, showing the Codex
  card (its windows with pace bars, `now` tick, projected %)

#### Scenario: Selector switches to all providers
- **WHEN** the user selects `All`
- **THEN** the dialog SHALL render a card for every provider in `/api/quota`

#### Scenario: Dialog inherits primitive behaviour
- **WHEN** the dialog is open
- **THEN** Esc and click-outside SHALL close it and it SHALL expose `role="dialog"`
  with `aria-modal`

### Requirement: Plugin load failure SHALL be isolated
A failure to load the quota-plugin (including an unavailable/broken
`@latentminds/pi-quotas`) SHALL NOT crash the dashboard shell.

#### Scenario: Broken dependency surfaced in health
- **WHEN** the quota-plugin fails to load
- **THEN** `/api/health.plugins[]` SHALL report it with an error and the rest of the
  shell SHALL function normally

### Requirement: Quota dialog SHALL offer an on-demand refresh
The quota detail dialog SHALL provide a refresh control in its header that
re-queries `GET /api/quota` on demand, independent of the background poll, and
SHALL surface how recent the shown data is via a relative "last updated"
caption. The compact footer widget SHALL NOT gain a refresh control. A refresh
SHALL be single-flight: a stale (out-of-order) response SHALL NOT overwrite a
newer one, and the control SHALL be disabled while a request is in flight.

#### Scenario: Refresh re-queries on demand
- **WHEN** the user activates the refresh control in the open dialog
- **THEN** the client SHALL issue a fresh `GET /api/quota` and render the
  returned snapshot, updating the "last updated" caption

#### Scenario: Out-of-order response is discarded
- **WHEN** a manual refresh is issued while a poll (or earlier refresh) request
  is still outstanding, and the older request resolves last
- **THEN** the client SHALL keep the newest response and SHALL NOT clobber it
  with the older one, and SHALL NOT report a "last updated" time older than the
  newest applied snapshot

#### Scenario: Refresh failure degrades honestly
- **WHEN** the refresh request fails
- **THEN** the client SHALL keep the previously shown snapshot and SHALL NOT
  render an error dialog

#### Scenario: Refresh dropping the selected provider falls back
- **WHEN** a refresh returns a snapshot that no longer contains the
  currently-selected provider
- **THEN** the dialog SHALL fall back to the `All` selection rather than render
  an empty detail view

### Requirement: Server SHALL retry transient quota-fetch failures within a bounded budget
When retry is enabled, the server SHALL retry a provider whose fetch failed with
a TRANSIENT kind (`http` 429/5xx, `timeout`, `network`) using an exponential
backoff, and SHALL NOT retry a TERMINAL kind (`no-credential`, `no-adapter`,
`no-data`). Classification requires the fetcher layer to surface the underlying
failure kind rather than a single opaque kind. Retry SHALL run within the
`/api/quota` request and SHALL be bounded by a per-provider total wall-clock
budget (covering both the between-attempt sleeps and each attempt's request
timeout), so one provider can neither stall the shared snapshot without limit
nor be resurrected across the poll. Retry SHALL respect the existing gates: a
disabled plugin or disabled provider SHALL trigger no fetch and therefore no
retry. Every retried attempt SHALL reuse the existing scrubbed error path; the
change SHALL add no new log or output path that can carry a token.

#### Scenario: Transient failure is retried then succeeds
- **WHEN** an enabled provider's first fetch fails with `http` 429 and a
  subsequent attempt within budget succeeds
- **THEN** `/api/quota` SHALL return that provider's live windows and SHALL NOT
  mark it stale or unavailable

#### Scenario: Terminal failure is not retried
- **WHEN** an enabled provider's fetch fails with `no-credential`
- **THEN** the server SHALL make no further attempt for that provider and SHALL
  report it via the existing stale/unavailable handling

#### Scenario: Retry stays within the total budget
- **WHEN** a provider keeps failing transiently
- **THEN** the server SHALL stop retrying once the per-provider total budget is
  exhausted, fall back to the stale/unavailable handling, and the added latency
  for that provider SHALL NOT exceed the budget

#### Scenario: Disabled provider is never retried
- **WHEN** retry is enabled but a provider is disabled (or the plugin is
  disabled)
- **THEN** the server SHALL make zero fetch attempts and zero retries for it

#### Scenario: One provider's retries do not multiply another's attempts
- **WHEN** two providers are enabled and only one is failing transiently
- **THEN** the healthy provider SHALL be fetched once and its result SHALL NOT
  be delayed beyond the shared snapshot's slowest-branch completion

### Requirement: Retry SHALL be configurable, off by default, bounded, with an honest schedule preview
Retry SHALL be governed by `plugins.quota.retry.{enabled,maxAttempts,baseDelayMs,maxDelayMs}`,
defaulting to disabled and turned on by neither migration nor upgrade.
`maxAttempts` SHALL mean retries AFTER the initial attempt (`0` disables retry),
matching the shell's retry-settings semantics. Every numeric field SHALL be
schema-bounded and clamped to a safe value on read, so a malformed persisted
config can never drive an unbounded wait or a timer overflow. The settings
section SHALL present the retry controls reusing the existing plugin-settings
element vocabulary (checkbox + labelled number inputs + schedule preview) rather
than bespoke UI, and SHALL display the backoff sequence and the TOTAL wall-clock
time the retries will consume — the between-attempt sleeps PLUS each attempt's
request timeout — before a provider is marked unavailable. Saving the settings
SHALL preserve the retry configuration alongside the existing enablement fields.

#### Scenario: Retry defaults off
- **WHEN** the plugin is enabled but no retry config was ever set
- **THEN** retry SHALL be disabled and the server SHALL make exactly one attempt
  per enabled provider

#### Scenario: Schedule preview states the real total
- **WHEN** the user sets `maxAttempts` and `baseDelayMs` in the settings
- **THEN** the preview SHALL render the backoff sequence and a total that
  INCLUDES the per-attempt request timeout, so the stated cost equals the
  worst-case wall-clock wait

#### Scenario: Malformed config is clamped, not obeyed
- **WHEN** the persisted retry config carries an out-of-range value (e.g. a
  negative or overflow-scale delay)
- **THEN** the server SHALL clamp it to the schema bound before any arithmetic
  or timer use and SHALL NOT produce an unbounded wait

#### Scenario: Saving provider toggles preserves retry
- **WHEN** the user changes a per-provider toggle and saves while a retry config
  exists
- **THEN** the persisted config SHALL retain the retry settings and SHALL NOT
  erase them

### Requirement: Server SHALL fetch opencode-go Go-subscription quota
When the plugin is enabled and `opencode-go` is enabled, the server SHALL fetch
the OpenCode **Go subscription** usage from `GET https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage`
with the `opencode-go` credential as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, resolved
through the host auth abstraction (never a hardcoded auth.json path). The request
SHALL carry a non-default `User-Agent` header, because the default client
fingerprint is rejected by the endpoint's edge (Cloudflare 1010 → HTTP 403) in a
way indistinguishable from an auth failure. The response's `usage.rolling`,
`usage.weekly`, and `usage.monthly` — each `{ status, percent, resetsAt }` — SHALL
map to normalized quota windows. A window SHALL be emitted whenever it carries a
finite `percent` AND a usable reset stamp, REGARDLESS of its `status` (so an
`exceeded`/throttled cadence is still shown, not hidden). `percent` SHALL be
treated as percent USED and clamped to `0..100`.

#### Scenario: Go usage exposed
- **WHEN** `opencode-go` is enabled and the endpoint returns
  `{ usage: { rolling: { status:"ok", percent, resetsAt }, weekly:{…}, monthly:{…} } }`
- **THEN** `GET /api/quota` SHALL include `opencode-go` with three normalized
  windows carrying `usedPercent` (0..100) and `resetsAt`

#### Scenario: User-Agent required
- **WHEN** the server fetches opencode-go quota
- **THEN** the request SHALL send a non-default `User-Agent` header so the edge
  does not reject it as a bot (which would surface as a false auth failure)

#### Scenario: No Go subscription on the key
- **WHEN** the endpoint returns 403 `EntitlementError` (valid key, not on Go)
- **THEN** the server SHALL treat it as a terminal failure, SHALL NOT retry, and
  SHALL report `opencode-go` as unavailable rather than a stale or zero window

#### Scenario: Edge block is not misread as no-subscription
- **WHEN** the endpoint returns a 403 whose body signals a Cloudflare 1010 edge
  block (not an entitlement error)
- **THEN** the server SHALL report `opencode-go` unavailable with a DISTINCT
  detail identifying the edge block, so it is not conflated with "no subscription"

#### Scenario: Non-ok window still emitted
- **WHEN** a returned window has a finite `percent` and reset stamp but a `status`
  other than `"ok"`
- **THEN** that window SHALL still be exposed with its real `percent`, NOT dropped

#### Scenario: Malformed percent dropped
- **WHEN** a returned window has a non-finite/absent `percent` or no reset stamp
- **THEN** that window SHALL be omitted rather than exposed as a misleading 0%

#### Scenario: Credential is header-only and correctly identified
- **WHEN** the opencode-go quota is fetched, exposed, or its error logged
- **THEN** the token SHALL be resolved for the `opencode-go` credential id (NOT
  the Zen `opencode` id), SHALL appear only in the request `Authorization`
  header, and no substring of it SHALL appear in `/api/quota`, any broadcast, or
  any log line

### Requirement: Wallet-balance and cookie-gated providers SHALL remain unsupported
The plugin SHALL NOT attempt a quota fetch for providers that expose only a wallet
balance with no resetting window (`deepseek`, `minimax`) or whose usage is reachable
only behind a browser-session cookie plus a workspace id — specifically the
OpenCode **Zen** pay-as-you-go gateway (`opencode`), whose balance requires the
`server.queryBilling` console RPC. This exclusion SHALL NOT apply to the OpenCode
**Go subscription** (`opencode-go`), which exposes a key-authenticated resetting-
window usage API and IS supported.

#### Scenario: Zen wallet not fetched
- **WHEN** the plugin is enabled
- **THEN** the server SHALL NOT call any `opencode` (Zen) balance/console endpoint
  and SHALL NOT list `opencode`, `deepseek`, or `minimax` as supported providers

#### Scenario: Go distinguished from Zen
- **WHEN** the supported-provider list is computed
- **THEN** it SHALL include `opencode-go` and SHALL NOT include `opencode`
