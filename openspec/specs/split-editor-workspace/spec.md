## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change split-editor-workspace. Update Purpose after archive.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Content area SHALL host a chat + editor split

The session content area SHALL support three layout **modes** —
`closed`, `split`, `full`. In `closed` the content area SHALL render `ChatView`
alone (default). In `split` it SHALL render `ChatView`, a draggable divider, and the
editor pane together. In `full` it SHALL render the editor pane alone with `ChatView`
collapsed to an edge **peek handle**.

On desktop the split SHALL be horizontal (chat left, editor right; chat peek on the
left edge in `full`, editor peek on the right edge in `closed`). At or below the
mobile breakpoint (`useMobile()` true) the split SHALL stack vertically (chat top,
editor bottom) and the peek handle SHALL be an edge grabber on the corresponding
stacked edge.

#### Scenario: Split mode shows both panes
- **GIVEN** a session in `closed` mode showing `ChatView`
- **WHEN** the user selects `split` from the header layout switch
- **THEN** the content area renders `ChatView`, a divider, and the editor pane
- **AND** the conversation remains visible and interactive

#### Scenario: Full mode via the header switch shows the editor alone
- **GIVEN** a session in `split` mode
- **WHEN** the user selects the `Editor` segment of the header switch
- **THEN** the content area renders the editor pane across the full width
- **AND** `ChatView` is collapsed to a peek handle on the leading edge

#### Scenario: Full mode preserves chat draft and scroll
- **GIVEN** `split` mode with unsent text in the composer and the chat scrolled up
- **WHEN** the mode becomes `full` and then `split` again
- **THEN** `ChatView` remains mounted while hidden (not remounted)
- **AND** the composer draft text and scroll position are unchanged on return

#### Scenario: Closed mode shows chat alone
- **GIVEN** a session in `split` or `full` mode
- **WHEN** the user selects `Chat`/`closed`
- **THEN** the content area renders `ChatView` alone
- **AND** the editor pane's persisted state (tabs, tree) is preserved

#### Scenario: Mobile stacks the split vertically
- **GIVEN** the viewport is below the mobile breakpoint
- **WHEN** the mode is `split`
- **THEN** `ChatView` renders above the editor pane with a row-resize divider

#### Scenario: Mobile supports full mode
- **GIVEN** the viewport is below the mobile breakpoint
- **WHEN** the user selects `Editor` (`full`) from the mobile layout switch
- **THEN** the editor pane fills the stacked content area
- **AND** `ChatView` collapses to an edge grabber on the stacked edge that restores `split` when activated

### Requirement: Split SHALL be unsplittable and re-splittable

The session header SHALL expose a **segmented layout switch** (`Chat | Split |
Editor`) that owns the layout axis. The switch SHALL be present in every mode
(including `closed`, where no pane header exists), SHALL indicate the current mode as
the active segment, and SHALL move the content area to any of the three modes in one
click. The legacy single "Split / Unsplit" toggle and the word "Unsplit" SHALL be
retired. Switching modes SHALL NOT destroy the editor pane's persisted state (open
tabs, tree expansion) or the chat conversation.

#### Scenario: Switch reaches any mode in one click
- **GIVEN** the layout switch shows `Split` active
- **WHEN** the user clicks the `Editor` segment
- **THEN** the content area enters `full` mode in a single transition

#### Scenario: Closed reachable directly from full
- **GIVEN** a session in `full` mode
- **WHEN** the user clicks the `Chat` segment
- **THEN** the content area enters `closed` mode
- **AND** the mode value never held `split` between the two states

#### Scenario: Layout switch is keyboard operable and announces the active mode
- **GIVEN** the header layout switch rendered as an exclusive control
- **WHEN** a keyboard user focuses it and presses Arrow keys
- **THEN** focus moves between the `Chat`/`Split`/`Editor` options and Enter/Space selects one
- **AND** the control exposes the current mode as the checked option to assistive tech (`role="radiogroup"`/`radio`, `aria-checked`)

#### Scenario: Mode change preserves pane state
- **GIVEN** `split` mode with three tabs in the editor pane
- **WHEN** the user switches to `closed` and back to `split`
- **THEN** the editor pane renders with the three tabs and the previously active one

#### Scenario: Switch is present when closed
- **GIVEN** a session in `closed` mode (chat only)
- **WHEN** the header renders
- **THEN** the `Chat | Split | Editor` switch is visible with `Chat` active

#### Scenario: Switch is present on mobile
- **GIVEN** the viewport is below the mobile breakpoint
- **WHEN** the mobile session header renders in any mode
- **THEN** the layout switch is present in the mobile header and reflects the current mode

### Requirement: Divider SHALL resize the split and persist the ratio

In `split` mode a draggable divider SHALL resize the two panes. The divider SHALL
be **resize-only**: it SHALL carry an always-visible dotted grip signifier and SHALL
NOT carry any collapse control. Collapsing a pane SHALL be driven solely by the
header layout-mode switch (`Chat│Split│Editor`). The split ratio SHALL be stored as a
fraction (0..1), clamped to `[0.25, 0.75]` so neither pane collapses below a usable
minimum, and SHALL persist per session. The ratio SHALL apply only in `split` mode.

#### Scenario: Dragging resizes both panes
- **WHEN** the user drags the divider left in `split` mode
- **THEN** the chat pane narrows and the editor pane widens by the same amount
- **AND** the divider stops at the clamp boundary before either pane collapses

#### Scenario: Divider carries no collapse control
- **GIVEN** `split` mode
- **THEN** the divider renders an always-visible dotted grip and no collapse chevrons
- **AND** the header switch is the only control that collapses a pane; the pane
  restore tabs only re-open a collapsed pane (they never collapse one)

#### Scenario: Grip is always visible, not hover-only
- **GIVEN** `split` mode with no pointer over the divider
- **THEN** the dotted grip signifier is visible at rest (not revealed only on hover)

#### Scenario: Ratio persists across reload
- **GIVEN** the user set the split ratio to 60/40
- **WHEN** the page reloads and the mode re-opens to `split`
- **THEN** the panes render at the 60/40 ratio

### Requirement: Split state SHALL persist per session in localStorage

Layout mode, ratio, and orientation SHALL persist under
`pi-dashboard:split:<sessionId>`, scoped per session id. Persistence SHALL be
best-effort: quota errors and corrupt JSON SHALL NOT crash the workspace. Legacy
persisted state that used the boolean `open` field SHALL migrate on read:
`open:true → mode:"split"`, `open:false → mode:"closed"`. Unrecognised or partial
blobs SHALL fall back to the default (`mode:"closed"`).

#### Scenario: Per-session mode
- **GIVEN** session A in `split` at 50/50 and session B in `closed`
- **WHEN** the user switches from A to B
- **THEN** session B renders in `closed`
- **AND** switching back to A restores `split` at 50/50

#### Scenario: Full mode persists across reload
- **GIVEN** a session left in `full` mode
- **WHEN** the page reloads and the session reopens
- **THEN** the content area renders in `full` (editor-only, chat behind its peek handle)
- **AND** the editor pane's persisted tabs are restored

#### Scenario: Legacy boolean state migrates
- **GIVEN** `localStorage` holds `{ "open": true, "ratio": 0.6, "orientation": "h" }`
- **WHEN** the session opens
- **THEN** the workspace renders in `split` mode at the 60/40 ratio
- **AND** subsequent writes persist the new `mode` shape

#### Scenario: Both-fields blob resolves by precedence and self-heals
- **GIVEN** `localStorage` holds `{ "open": false, "mode": "split", "ratio": 0.5, "orientation": "h" }`
- **WHEN** the session opens
- **THEN** `mode` wins and the workspace renders in `split` (the stale `open:false` is ignored)
- **AND** the next persisted write contains `mode` and NO `open` key

#### Scenario: Corrupt state does not crash
- **GIVEN** `localStorage` holds malformed JSON for `pi-dashboard:split:<id>`
- **WHEN** the session opens
- **THEN** the workspace renders in `closed` mode (default)
- **AND** an error is logged and subsequent mode changes function normally

### Requirement: Opening a file auto-opens the split

The pane SHALL route file-open entry points (chat file-link, tool-result file path,
file-tree click, search-result selection, auto-canvas target) through the shared
openers (`openInSplit` / `openLiveTarget` / `openUrlTarget`). Each opener, and the
param-less `/session/:id/editor` deep-link mode transition, SHALL reveal the split
**only when the current mode is `closed`**; when the editor is already shown (`split`
or `full`) the mode SHALL be left unchanged. The opener SHALL open the file in the
editor pane and scroll to the requested line when provided. (The `live:preview`
button in the editor pane dispatches `openFile` directly and never changes the mode;
it is exempt as a mode-preserving in-pane action.)

#### Scenario: Clicking a file-link in chat auto-splits
- **GIVEN** the split is closed
- **WHEN** the user clicks a file path rendered in a chat message or tool result
- **THEN** the split opens
- **AND** the clicked file opens in the editor pane as the active tab

#### Scenario: Opening a file in full keeps full
- **GIVEN** `full` mode (editor only, chat hidden)
- **WHEN** the user opens a file (file-tree click, chat file-link, or search select)
- **THEN** the mode stays `full`
- **AND** the opened file becomes the active tab
- **AND** chat stays hidden

#### Scenario: Opening a file in split stays split
- **GIVEN** `split` mode
- **WHEN** the user opens a file
- **THEN** the mode stays `split`
- **AND** the opened file becomes the active tab

#### Scenario: Deep-link route opens the split
- **GIVEN** the split is closed
- **WHEN** the user navigates to `/session/:id/editor?file=src/foo.ts&line=42`
- **THEN** the split opens with `src/foo.ts` active, scrolled to line 42
- **AND** `ChatView` remains rendered alongside the pane

### Requirement: Peek handles SHALL restore a collapsed pane

Each pane SHALL show an always-visible caption (`CHAT` / `EDITOR`) at its top while
open; the caption SHALL be folded into the pane's existing header row, NOT added as
a second bar. This requirement governs the **desktop horizontal split
(`orientation "h"`)**; the stacked mobile split (`orientation "v"`) is out of scope
here and retains the existing edge-grabber peek behavior defined by the untouched
"Content area SHALL host a chat + editor split" requirement, and the tablet
`replaceChat` tier (editor replaces chat, no side-by-side) renders no caption,
divider, or restore tab. When a pane is collapsed the workspace SHALL render an
**always-visible, in-flow rotated tab** on the collapsed pane's edge so the pane is
re-openable without the header (this tab is the desktop form of the affordance the
parent requirement calls a "peek handle"). The restore tab SHALL be an in-flow
sibling that reduces content width (push), and SHALL NOT overlay or clip the
adjacent pane's content. In `closed` mode a right-edge `EDITOR` tab SHALL re-open to
`split`. In `full` mode a leading-edge `CHAT` tab SHALL restore `split`. Activating a
tab SHALL NOT destroy the other pane's state. The restore tab SHALL be a keyboard-
focusable control with an accessible name (activated by Enter/Space); the pane
caption SHALL be decorative (`aria-hidden`) or carry an accessible label, not a
bare unlabeled element. A content-driven opener SHALL NOT change the mode when the
editor is already shown.

#### Scenario: Editor tab reopens the split
- **GIVEN** `closed` mode (chat only)
- **WHEN** the user activates the right-edge `EDITOR` tab
- **THEN** the mode becomes `split` and the editor pane renders with its prior tabs

#### Scenario: Chat tab restores chat
- **GIVEN** `full` mode (editor only)
- **WHEN** the user activates the leading-edge `CHAT` tab
- **THEN** the mode becomes `split` and the conversation is visible again

#### Scenario: Restore tab never overlaps a narrow pane
- **GIVEN** `split` collapsed to a narrow chat pane, then a pane collapsed
- **THEN** the restore tab and pane caption sit at the pane edge as in-flow elements
- **AND** they do NOT overlay or clip the visible pane's content

#### Scenario: Content opener from full stays full
- **GIVEN** `full` mode (editor only)
- **WHEN** a content-driven opener fires (e.g. the header Changed-Files chip, a chat
  file-link, or an auto-canvas target)
- **THEN** the mode stays `full` — the opener never forces `split` when the editor is
  already shown
- **AND** the opened content appears in the editor pane per the open-intent rules
  (foreground activates; agent-driven adds in the background)

#### Scenario: Mobile stacked split keeps its existing edge grabber
- **GIVEN** the split renders stacked (`orientation "v"`) on a mobile viewport
- **WHEN** a pane is collapsed
- **THEN** the existing edge-grabber peek restores the pane (unchanged)
- **AND** the desktop rotated-tab form is NOT required in this orientation

#### Scenario: Restore tab is keyboard accessible
- **GIVEN** a collapsed pane showing its restore tab
- **WHEN** the user focuses the tab and presses Enter or Space
- **THEN** the pane re-opens to `split`
- **AND** the tab exposes an accessible name to assistive tech

### Requirement: Editor pane SHALL host terminal tabs alongside file tabs

The editor pane (in both the session split and the folder-scoped pane) SHALL host terminal tabs (`term:<id>`, viewer kind `terminal`) in the same tab strip as file, diff, and live-server tabs. Terminal tabs SHALL participate in the same activation, reorder, and close behaviors as other tabs. See `terminal-viewer-tab` for terminal lifecycle.

#### Scenario: Terminal tab coexists with file tabs

- **GIVEN** an editor pane with `src/foo.ts` open
- **WHEN** a terminal tab `term:t1` is opened
- **THEN** both tabs SHALL appear in the tab strip and be independently selectable

### Requirement: Pane SHALL expose a new-terminal affordance

The editor pane SHALL provide a control to create a new terminal at the pane's cwd and open it as an active tab. Activating the control SHALL call the terminal-create flow and add the resulting `term:<id>` tab.

#### Scenario: Create a terminal from the pane

- **WHEN** the user activates the pane's new-terminal control in a pane rooted at `/home/u/proj`
- **THEN** a terminal SHALL be created with cwd `/home/u/proj`
- **AND** its `term:<id>` tab SHALL open active in the pane

### Requirement: File opens SHALL declare foreground or background intent

Every file-open call SHALL declare its intent so the pane can protect what the user
is reading. **User-initiated** opens (file-tree click, chat file-link, tool-result
file path, search-result select, Open-file button, change-summary diff link, the
mobile canvas chip tap) SHALL be **foreground**: reveal the split when `closed`,
keep the current mode otherwise, and activate the opened tab. The **only**
agent-initiated open is the **auto-canvas driver effect** (file, `live-server`, and
`url` targets); it SHALL be **background** when the editor is already shown (`split`
or `full`): the tab SHALL be added **without** changing the active tab, SHALL be
marked **unread**, and SHALL play a one-time highlight so it is noticed without
stealing focus. When the mode is `closed`, a background open SHALL reveal `split` and
activate the opened tab (no reading context exists to protect). A call site that does
not declare intent SHALL default to **foreground**.

#### Scenario: Agent auto-open while reading another tab does not steal focus
- **GIVEN** `split` or `full` mode with tab `a.ts` active and being read
- **WHEN** the agent auto-opens `b.ts` (auto-canvas or tool-result path)
- **THEN** `a.ts` stays the active tab and its content is undisturbed
- **AND** a new `b.ts` tab is added, marked unread, with a one-time highlight
- **AND** the mode is unchanged

#### Scenario: Agent auto-open from closed reveals and shows the file
- **GIVEN** `closed` mode (chat only)
- **WHEN** the agent auto-opens `b.ts`
- **THEN** the mode becomes `split`
- **AND** `b.ts` is the active tab (nothing was being read to protect)

#### Scenario: User click always activates
- **GIVEN** `split` or `full` mode with tab `a.ts` active
- **WHEN** the user clicks `b.ts` in the file tree, a chat file-link, or a search result
- **THEN** `b.ts` becomes the active tab
- **AND** `b.ts` is not marked unread

#### Scenario: Unread clears on activation
- **GIVEN** a background-added tab `b.ts` marked unread
- **WHEN** the user activates `b.ts` (click or keyboard)
- **THEN** the unread marker on `b.ts` is cleared

#### Scenario: Unread survives reload
- **GIVEN** a background-added tab `b.ts` marked unread, still not activated
- **WHEN** the page reloads
- **THEN** `b.ts` is still present and still marked unread

### Requirement: Chat pane SHALL budget its height so no row is clipped

The chat pane renders a scrollable transcript among a stack of furniture rows
(sticky header slot, session banner, context strip, status bar, queue panel,
composer, and any `content-inline-footer` plugin contributions). The pane SHALL
apportion its height so that the composer cannot grow at the expense of the rows
below it, and so that the transcript is never reduced to nothing.

Every row of the pane SHALL be classified, explicitly and in one place, as either
**shrinkable** or **fixed**:

- A row is shrinkable only if it owns a scrollport, so that reducing its height
  hides content behind a scrollbar rather than outside its box. Each shrinkable
  row SHALL declare a shrink weight and a lower bound.
- Every other row is fixed. A fixed row SHALL hold its content height and SHALL
  NOT be shrunk, because a row that neither clips nor scrolls would paint its
  content over its neighbour rather than hide it.

Rows that render conditionally (session banner, queue panel, plugin slot
contributions, the transcript's error-boundary fallback) are classified the same
way and are part of the pane's budget whenever they are present, so the floor sum
— the declared transcript floor, plus the composer's base height, plus the content
heights of the fixed rows currently rendered — is a function of pane state rather
than a constant.

The pane SHALL declare the transcript floor explicitly rather than inheriting an
emergent one. Each shrinkable row's declared floor SHALL be greater than its lower
bound, so that the row has height to give; a row whose floor equals its bound
cannot participate in the allocation at all.

At and above the floor sum every row SHALL render at full height, and no fixed row
SHALL be selected to absorb a height deficit.

Below the floor sum the pane SHALL distribute the deficit across the shrinkable
rows by applying each row's declared weight to its own base height, and SHALL NOT
let one shrinkable row absorb the whole deficit while another is still above its
lower bound. A shrinkable row's share SHALL be determined by its own weight and
base height, and SHALL NOT depend on its position among its siblings.

Only once every shrinkable row has reached its lower bound MAY the residual
shortfall be clipped by the pane's boundary. That the residual is then taken from
the bottom-most row is a declared consequence of the pane's clipping boundary, not
an allocation: the contract's guarantee is that no row is asked to give before the
scrollable rows have given everything.

The composer SHALL be bounded to a fraction of the pane's height rather than to a
fixed pixel height, and SHALL scroll its own content when it reaches that bound.

#### Scenario: Bottom furniture stays fully visible in a short pane

- **GIVEN** a pane at least as tall as the floor sum
- **WHEN** the chat pane is short enough that its transcript has no spare space to
  give up
- **THEN** every furniture row below the transcript SHALL render at its full height
  and remain entirely visible within the pane
- **AND** no row SHALL be cut off by the pane's bottom edge

#### Scenario: Below the floor sum the deficit is shared by the shrinkable rows

- **GIVEN** a pane shorter than the floor sum but taller than the sum of the
  shrinkable rows' lower bounds and the fixed rows' content heights
- **WHEN** the chat pane is rendered
- **THEN** every shrinkable row SHALL be shorter than its base height
- **AND** no shrinkable row SHALL absorb the entire deficit while another is still
  above its lower bound
- **AND** every fixed row SHALL still render at its content height
- **AND** no row's content SHALL be painted outside that row's own box

#### Scenario: Deficit allocation grows continuously with the shortfall

- **GIVEN** a pane shrinking from the floor sum downward
- **WHEN** the pane height decreases step by step
- **THEN** each shrinkable row's height SHALL decrease monotonically with the
  shortfall
- **AND** no row SHALL be removed or hidden in one step
- **AND** the transcript SHALL retain a non-zero height at every step, so its
  virtualized viewport is never measured at zero

#### Scenario: A shrinkable row at its lower bound stops absorbing

- **GIVEN** a pane far enough below the floor sum that one shrinkable row has
  reached its declared lower bound
- **WHEN** the pane shrinks further
- **THEN** that row SHALL hold at its lower bound
- **AND** the additional deficit SHALL be taken from the shrinkable rows still
  above their lower bounds
- **AND** the fixed rows SHALL remain at their content heights until every
  shrinkable row is at its bound

#### Scenario: Residual shortfall is clipped only as a last resort

- **GIVEN** a pane shorter than every row can collectively accommodate
- **WHEN** every shrinkable row has reached its lower bound
- **THEN** the residual shortfall MAY be clipped by the pane's boundary
- **AND** this SHALL NOT occur at any pane height where a shrinkable row is still
  above its lower bound

#### Scenario: A long draft does not push the bottom rows out of the pane

- **GIVEN** a chat pane whose rows currently all fit
- **WHEN** the user types a draft long enough to grow the composer to its maximum
- **THEN** the composer SHALL stop growing at its bound and scroll its own content
- **AND** the rows below the composer SHALL remain fully visible

#### Scenario: Transcript retains a share of the pane

- **GIVEN** a pane at least as tall as the floor sum
- **WHEN** the composer is at its maximum size in a short pane
- **THEN** the transcript SHALL retain a non-zero share of the pane's height
- **AND** SHALL NOT be collapsed to zero height

#### Scenario: A conditional row raises the floor sum while it is rendered

- **GIVEN** a pane rendering a conditional row (session banner, queue panel, or a
  plugin slot contribution)
- **WHEN** the pane sits at a height that was at or above the floor sum without
  that row
- **THEN** the conditional row SHALL count toward the floor sum while it is
  rendered
- **AND** the deficit it introduces SHALL be taken from the shrinkable rows before
  any row is clipped

#### Scenario: Mobile stacked split keeps the pane's rows visible

- **GIVEN** a viewport below the mobile breakpoint in `split` mode, where the chat
  pane occupies only part of the stacked content area
- **AND** the chat pane is at least as tall as the floor sum
- **WHEN** the chat pane is rendered
- **THEN** the composer and every row below it SHALL remain fully visible within
  the chat pane
- **AND** when the user drags the split divider to its minimum ratio, which on a
  small phone puts the pane below the floor sum, the shortfall SHALL be taken from
  the shrinkable rows rather than clipped off the bottom-most row
