# Design

## Context

The composer's model dropdown paints *behind* the composer context strip above it. The panel is an inline `absolute … z-50` child of the composer, so raising the number cannot help: a `z-index` only orders siblings **within the nearest ancestor stacking context**, and the panel is trapped in one.

This defect class is solved in this repo. `FolderActionsMenu` underlapped `SessionCard` (which sets `isolate`) and was fixed by portaling. `LayerPortal`'s own doc comment names the rule — *"portal-or-perish"* — and `usePopoverFlip` already returns `triggerRect` explicitly so a portaled consumer can position a `fixed` panel. This change applies that shipped pattern to the two `settings/` selectors; it invents nothing.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals**
- Model dropdown paints above all composer chrome, in both flip directions.
- `ThinkingLevelSelector` gets the same treatment (same toolbar, same construction, same latent bug).
- `scripts/z-layer-baseline.json` shrinks by exactly 2 entries.
- No change to pane-clamped sizing, flip behaviour, keyboard nav, or focus restore.

**Non-Goals**
- `CommandInput`'s three popovers — still on the allowlist, deliberately deferred.
- A mobile bottom-sheet form (`useMobile()` → `DialogPortal`) for either selector. Desktop popover form only; these live in a desktop composer toolbar.
- Extracting a shared portaled-popover component from three call sites.

## Decision 1 — Portal, don't renumber

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Raise `z-50` → `z-[9999]` | **Rejected.** Does nothing across a stacking-context boundary; this is the exact anti-pattern the spec's requirement text calls out. |
| Remove the ancestor's stacking context | **Rejected.** The context is load-bearing chrome; unclear blast radius, and the panel would still be clipped by any `overflow` ancestor. |
| **Portal to the layer root + `fixed`** | **Chosen.** Escapes *every* ancestor context and every `overflow` clip at once. Already shipped for `FolderActionsMenu`. |

Portaling also fixes clipping, which renumbering cannot — the screenshot's clean horizontal cut at the toolbar's border is consistent with an `overflow` clip, not only paint order. One mechanism covers both candidate causes.

## Decision 2 — Positioning

Copy `FolderActionsMenu`'s `desktopStyle` shape exactly (`FolderActionsMenu.tsx:126-143`), including its two non-obvious details:

- `GAP = 4` replaces the `mt-1` / `mb-1` the inline form used — a portaled `fixed` panel has no flow sibling to get margin from.
- `visibility: triggerRect ? "visible" : "hidden"` — `triggerRect` is `null` on first render, so without this the panel flashes at `(0,0)` before the first measure lands.

Flip/anchor semantics are unchanged; only how the decision is *applied* changes:

| | Inline (before) | Portaled (after) |
|---|---|---|
| `flipUp` | `bottom-full mb-1` | `bottom: innerHeight - triggerRect.top + GAP` |
| else | `top-full mt-1` | `top: triggerRect.bottom + GAP` |
| `anchorRight` | `right-0` | `right: innerWidth - triggerRect.right` |
| else | `left-0` | `left: triggerRect.left` |

`boundaryRef` (`usePopoverBoundary()`) stays wired as-is — the hook keeps clamping `maxHeight`/`maxWidth` to the chat pane, so pane-aware sizing survives portaling. `ModelSelector` keeps `width: Math.min(320, maxWidth)`; `ThinkingLevelSelector` keeps its fixed `w-32` and does not destructure `maxWidth`.

`z-50` → the `z-popover` token, per the layer scale.

## Decision 3 — The outside-click trap

`ModelSelector.tsx:452` and `ThinkingLevelSelector.tsx:48` both close on:

```js
if (containerRef.current && !containerRef.current.contains(e.target)) setOpen(false);
```

Once portaled, the panel is **no longer a DOM descendant of `containerRef`** — so every click inside the dropdown reads as "outside" and the panel closes before any selection registers. The fix is non-optional; without it the feature is unusable.

Adopt `FolderActionsMenu.tsx:155-166`: add a `panelRef`, and treat *either* node as inside.

```js
if (panelRef.current?.contains(target)) return;
if (triggerRef.current?.contains(target)) return;
onOpenChange(false);
```

Two notes: check `panelRef` **before** `triggerRef` (the trigger toggles, so letting a panel click fall through to it would close-then-reopen), and the reference adds `touchstart` alongside `mousedown`.

## Decision 4 — `body` is the DEFAULT layer host, not the only one

The OpenSpec-dialog risk below **materialised**. `Dialog` renders `fixed inset-0
z-dialog` over a full-viewport `bg-black/60` backdrop; once the panel portals to
`document.body` the two become siblings in the root stacking context at 40 vs
50, so the dropdown sinks behind the backdrop and every click on it hits the
backdrop and dismisses the dialog. Verified structurally: both nodes
`parentElement === document.body`, tokens `z-popover` / `z-dialog`.

| Option | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Dialog-hosted panels adopt `z-dialog` (equal rank, later in DOM order) | **Rejected.** Leans on mount order, which the spec's *"outcome does not depend on … DOM order"* scenario forbids. |
| New token above `dialog` | **Rejected.** Contradicts the single-total-scale requirement and needs a spec delta for a purely local problem. |
| **Portal to the NEAREST layer host** | **Chosen.** `LayerHostContext` (default `null` → `document.body`); `Dialog` publishes its panel as the host. |

The popover then lives *inside* the dialog's stacking context, so it rides the
dialog's rank against the rest of the scale instead of competing with it — no
new token, no scale change, no spec delta. It also lands inside the dialog's
focus trap (where the pre-change inline panel already was) and inside the
escape-stack's notion of the dialog. The composer/card case is untouched: no
provider above it → `null` → `body`, still escaping every ancestor context.

`position: fixed` keeps the panel unclipped by the panel's `overflow-y-auto`, as
a fixed box's containing block is the viewport (no `transform`/`filter`/
`contain` on the chain). Confirmed in the browser.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| **Existing tests break.** `ThinkingLevelSelector.test.tsx` scopes every assertion to `container.querySelector('[data-testid="thinking-level-dropdown"]')`. A portal renders to `document.body`, *outside* `container` — these go null. | Expected and diagnostic, not incidental: a red test here proves the portal works. Re-scope to `screen` / `baseElement`. Confirmed at `ThinkingLevelSelector.test.tsx:16,27,35,45`. |
| **OpenSpec dialogs re-mount both selectors** (`components/openspec/useOpenSpecRunConfigRow.tsx`). A popover portaled to `body` must still sit above a dialog that is itself portaled. | **Occurred.** `z-popover` (40) is *below* `z-dialog` (50) on the scale, and the dropdown WAS occluded by its own host dialog. Resolved by Decision 4 (nearest layer host); locked in by `OpenSpecRunConfig.test.tsx` §"popover layering inside a real Dialog" + `LayerPortal.test.tsx`. |
| Panel detaches from trigger on scroll. | `usePopoverFlip` already re-measures on scroll/resize (capture-phase) — the behaviour the spec's trigger-rect scenario requires. No new work; verify. |

## Verification

1. `z-layer-lint.mjs` passes with the 2 baseline entries deleted (proves no raw `z-` remains in either file).
2. Unit tests green after re-scoping.
3. Manual, at the reported breakpoint: open the model dropdown upward in the composer — no occlusion, no clipping, first row clickable; repeat for the thinking-level selector and inside an OpenSpec run-config dialog. Run it on an isolated stack (`isolated-ui-verification`), not the live `:8000` instance.
