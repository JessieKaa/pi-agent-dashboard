# Tasks

## 1. Red tests first

- [x] 1.1 Re-scope `packages/client/src/__tests__/ThinkingLevelSelector.test.tsx` off `container.querySelector` (lines 16, 27, 35, 45, …) onto `screen` / `baseElement` queries, so the dropdown is found wherever it renders; verify the suite still passes against the CURRENT inline implementation (a re-scope must not depend on the fix).
- [x] 1.2 Add a test asserting a `mousedown` **inside** the open model dropdown does NOT close it (select a model via click and assert `onSelect` fired); verify it passes pre-change — it is the regression guard for the portal outside-click trap.
- [x] 1.3 Add a test asserting the open panel is NOT a descendant of the `[data-testid="model-selector"]` container (i.e. it is portaled) and carries the `z-popover` class; verify it FAILS now — this is the red test for the bug.
- [x] 1.4 Mirror 1.3 for `ThinkingLevelSelector`; verify it fails now.

## 2. ModelSelector → portaled layer surface

- [x] 2.1 Import `LayerPortal` and destructure `triggerRect` from `usePopoverFlip`; add a `panelRef`. Verify `npx tsc --noEmit` in `packages/client` is clean.
- [x] 2.2 Build the `fixed` positioning style from `triggerRect`/`flipUp`/`anchorRight` per design.md's table, including `GAP = 4` and the `visibility` guard against the pre-measure `(0,0)` flash; keep `width: Math.min(320, maxWidth)`, `maxHeight`, `minHeight`. Verify by opening the dropdown in both flip directions — panel sits flush to the trigger, no flash on open.
- [x] 2.3 Wrap the open panel in `<LayerPortal>`, swap `absolute … z-50` + the `left-0/right-0/top-full/bottom-full` classes for `fixed z-popover`, and attach `panelRef`. Verify test 1.3 now passes.
- [x] 2.4 Fix outside-click: check `panelRef` **before** `triggerRef`, return early for both, and add `touchstart` beside `mousedown`. Verify test 1.2 still passes and clicking outside still closes.

## 3. ThinkingLevelSelector → same treatment

- [x] 3.1 Apply the identical port (portal, `fixed z-popover`, `triggerRect` positioning, `panelRef` + two-ref outside-click), keeping the fixed `w-32` and NOT destructuring `maxWidth`. Verify test 1.4 passes and the suite from 1.1 is green.

## 4. Shrink the ratchet

- [x] 4.1 Delete the `settings/ModelSelector.tsx|z-50` and `settings/ThinkingLevelSelector.tsx|z-50` entries from `scripts/z-layer-baseline.json` (35 → 33). Verify `node scripts/z-layer-lint.mjs` passes — it proves no raw `z-` remains in either file.

## 5. Verify the whole

- [x] 5.1 Run the full client suite (`set -o pipefail; npm test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/pi-test.log`, then grep the summary pattern); verify no regressions in `SettingsPanel`, `OpenSpecRunConfig`, `StatusBar`, `shell-primitives`.
- [x] 5.2 Verify on an ISOLATED stack (server `:8199` + Vite `:5199` under a throwaway `HOME`, per the `isolated-ui-verification` skill — the live `:8000` instance stays untouched, and no `npm run build` leaks into its `dist/`) and manually confirm the ORIGINAL reported bug: open the model dropdown upward in the composer — fully visible above the context strip, not clipped at the toolbar border, first row clickable.
- [x] 5.3 Manually verify both selectors inside an OpenSpec run-config dialog — the popover must not be occluded by its host dialog (`z-popover` 40 sits below `z-dialog` 50), and must still track its trigger when the chat pane scrolls. **Found broken** — portaling to `body` sank both dropdowns behind the dialog backdrop. Fixed in §6.
- [x] 5.4 Run `review-code` on the final diff (per the proposal's Discipline Skills) and address findings before commit.

## 6. Layer host — portal to the nearest host, not always `body`

Fallout of 5.3: `Dialog` paints at `z-dialog` (50) behind a full-viewport
`bg-black/60` backdrop, so a popover portaled to `document.body` becomes its
sibling at `z-popover` (40) — it sinks behind the backdrop and every click on it
hits the backdrop and dismisses the dialog. See design.md Decision 4.

- [x] 6.1 Red tests: in `OpenSpecRunConfig.test.tsx`, render the row inside the REAL `Dialog` (not the `role="dialog"` stand-in, which only exercises boundary resolution) and assert each dropdown is a DESCENDANT of the dialog panel, plus a contrast case asserting the host-less composer path still portals to `body`. Verify the two dialog tests FAIL and the contrast one passes.
- [x] 6.2 `LayerPortal`: add `LayerHostContext` (default `null`) + `LayerHostProvider`; portal to `host ?? document.body`. Verify `packages/client-utils/src/__tests__/LayerPortal.test.tsx` covers all three states (no host, host, host-still-mounting).
- [x] 6.3 `Dialog`: hold the panel element in state via a callback ref (the existing `containerRef` stays, so `useFocusTrap` is untouched) and wrap `{children}` in `LayerHostProvider`. Verify 6.1's tests pass and `Dialog`/`useFocusTrap` suites stay green.
- [x] 6.4 Re-verify in the browser: dropdown paints above the dialog, unclipped by the panel's `overflow-y-auto`, a row click selects WITHOUT dismissing the dialog, and the composer case still escapes to `body`.
