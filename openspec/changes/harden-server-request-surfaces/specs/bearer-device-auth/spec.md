## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Long-lived opaque bearer tokens in a revocable registry
A long-lived opaque bearer token SHALL be recorded in a server-side
paired-devices registry (`~/.pi/dashboard/paired-devices.json`, `0600`) with
device label, created-at, last-seen, and an issuance `source`. Tokens SHALL be
issued by one of two paths: redeeming a pairing code (`source: "pairing"`) or
direct issuance by an authenticated operator (`source: "manual"`). Both paths
SHALL return the plaintext token exactly once and store only a hash. The token
SHALL be revocable per device by deleting its registry entry regardless of
source. Registry rows written before `source` existed SHALL read as `"pairing"`.

Revocation SHALL accept only an **operator** credential — the same admission
rule as direct token issuance: an authenticated dashboard login session, a
valid `X-Pi-Local-Token`, or a genuinely local (loopback, non-forwarded)
caller. A request authenticated only by a paired-device bearer SHALL NOT
revoke any registry row, including its own, regardless of the caller's network
position — a device bearer arriving over loopback SHALL be refused on the
strength of the credential alone.

#### Scenario: Token issued and recorded
- **WHEN** a device successfully redeems a pairing code
- **THEN** an opaque bearer token is returned and a registry entry with `source: "pairing"` is created for the device

#### Scenario: Device revoked
- **WHEN** a user revokes a device from Settings
- **THEN** its registry entry is deleted and subsequent requests bearing that token are rejected

#### Scenario: Paired device cannot revoke a sibling
- **GIVEN** two paired devices A and B exist in the registry
- **WHEN** a request authenticated only by device A's bearer sends `DELETE /api/paired-devices/<id of B>`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond `401`
- **AND** device B's registry row SHALL remain and its token SHALL continue to verify

#### Scenario: Paired device cannot revoke itself
- **WHEN** a request authenticated only by device A's bearer sends `DELETE /api/paired-devices/<id of A>`
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond `401` and device A's row SHALL remain

#### Scenario: Loopback device bearer cannot revoke
- **WHEN** a request authenticated only by device A's bearer sends `DELETE /api/paired-devices/<id of B>` from `127.0.0.1` with no forwarding headers
- **THEN** the server SHALL respond `401` and device B's row SHALL remain

#### Scenario: Operator revokes over a tunnel
- **WHEN** a request carrying an authenticated dashboard login session sends `DELETE /api/paired-devices/<id>` from a non-local address
- **THEN** the server SHALL revoke the row and respond `200`

#### Scenario: Legacy row without source
- **WHEN** the registry file contains a row that has no `source` field
- **THEN** the row SHALL be listed with `source: "pairing"`
- **AND** its token SHALL continue to verify
