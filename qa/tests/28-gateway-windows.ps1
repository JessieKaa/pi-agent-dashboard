# Test: the Windows half of gateway transport + identity.
#
# Windows is the platform where every claim in this change inverts. There is no
# unix-socket path, so `resolveLocalGatewayEndpoint` falls back to
# `127.0.0.1:<piPort>` unconditionally — which means the kernel-decided
# permission of D5 is GONE and a loopback port plus a token is doing the work
# instead. That is not a smaller claim, it is a different one, and it cannot be
# checked from a POSIX box.
#
# Four sections, in falling order of certainty:
#   1. loopback endpoint, no socket anywhere      (task 5.1)
#   2. a bridge connects, drops, and reconnects   (task 5.7)
#   3. a stale record is not adopted              (tasks 5.7, 2.0h)
#   4. a second OS user cannot read the credentials (tasks 5.5 / 12.53)
#      — all THREE of them: local/token, identity.key and paired-devices.json.
#        They share the tree and the inherited ACL, but one file's answer is not
#        evidence for its neighbours', so each is inspected AND read-attempted
#        separately.
#
#        A run that yields no read verdict FAILS. windows-latest demonstrably
#        can yield one — observed READ-DENIED for all three on 2026-09-14 — so a
#        silent pass here would only ever hide a broken harness.
#
# Section 4 is the one that used to prove infeasible on a hosted runner rather
# than false: `chmod` is a documented no-op on Windows, so the guarantee rests
# entirely on inherited NTFS ACLs, and observing that honestly needs a real
# second user. It turned out the hosted runner COULD do it — the probe had been
# writing its verdict where the second user could not reach it — so §4 now
# requires a verdict and fails without one.
